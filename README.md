## Changelog

See the [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) file for the changes associated with
each release of this application. Changes that have been merged to `master`,
but not yet an official release may also be noted in the file under the
`Unreleased` section. A helpful link to the Git commit history since the last
official release is also provided for further review.

## Requirements

The following is a loose guideline. Other combinations of Go and operating
systems for building and running tools from this repo may work, but have not
been tested.

### Building source code

- Go
  - see this project's `go.mod` file for *preferred* version
  - this project tests against [officially supported Go
    releases][go-supported-releases]
    - the most recent stable release (aka, "stable")
    - the prior, but still supported release (aka, "oldstable")
- GCC
  - if building with custom options (as the provided `Makefile` does)
- `make`
  - if using the provided `Makefile`

### Running

- Microsoft Windows 10
- Ubuntu 20.04

## Installation

### From source

1. [Download][go-docs-download] Go
1. [Install][go-docs-install] Go
1. Clone the repo
   1. `cd /tmp`
   1. `git clone https://github.com/atc0005/safelinks`
   1. `cd safelinks`
1. Install dependencies (optional)
   - for Ubuntu Linux
     - `sudo apt-get install make gcc`
   - for CentOS Linux
     1. `sudo yum install make gcc`
1. Build
   - for the detected current operating system and architecture, explicitly
     using bundled dependencies in top-level `vendor` folder
     - most likely this is what you want (if building manually)
     - `go build -mod=vendor ./cmd/usl/`
     - `go build -mod=vendor ./cmd/dsl/`
   - manually, explicitly specifying target OS and architecture
     - `GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -mod=vendor ./cmd/usl/`
       - substitute `GOARCH=amd64` with the appropriate architecture if using
         different hardware (e.g., `GOARCH=arm64` or `GOARCH=386`)
       - substitute `GOOS=linux` with the appropriate OS if using a different
         platform (e.g., `GOOS=windows`)
     - `GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -mod=vendor ./cmd/dsl/`
   - using Makefile `all` recipe
     - `make all`
       - generates x86 and x64 binaries
   - using Makefile `release-build` recipe
     - `make release-build`
       - generates the same release assets as provided by this project's
         releases
1. Locate generated binaries
   - if using `Makefile`
     - look in `/tmp/safelinks/release_assets/usl/`
     - look in `/tmp/safelinks/release_assets/dsl/`
   - if using `go build`
     - look in `/tmp/safelinks/`
1. Copy the applicable binaries to whatever systems needs to run them so that
   they can be deployed

**NOTE**: Depending on which `Makefile` recipe you use the generated binary
may be compressed and have an `xz` extension. If so, you should decompress the
binary first before deploying it (e.g., `xz -d usl-linux-amd64.xz`).

### Using release binaries

1. Download the [latest release][releases-url] binaries
1. Decompress binaries
   - e.g., `xz -d usl-linux-amd64.xz`
   - 7-Zip also works well for this on Windows systems (e.g., for systems
     without Git for Windows or WSL)
1. Copy the applicable binaries to whatever systems needs to run them so that
   they can be deployed

**NOTE**:

DEB and RPM packages are provided as an alternative to manually deploying
binaries.

### Deployment

1. Place `usl` in a location where it can be easily accessed
1. Place `dsl` in a location where it can be easily accessed

## Configuration

### Command-line arguments

- Use the `-h` or `--help` flag to display current usage information.
- Flags marked as **`required`** must be set via CLI flag.
- Flags *not* marked as required are for settings where a useful default is
  already defined, but may be overridden if desired.

> [!NOTE]
> üõ†Ô∏è The `dsl` tool does not yet support CLI arguments.

#### `usl`

##### Flags

| Flag             | Required | Default | Repeat | Possible             | Description                                                                   |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------- | ------ | -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `h`, `help`      | No       | `false` | No     | `h`, `help`          | Show Help text along with the list of supported flags.                        |
| `version`        | No       | `false` | No     | `version`            | Whether to display application version and then immediately exit application. |
| `v`, `verbose`   | No       | `false` | No     | `v`, `verbose`       | Display additional information about a given Safe Links URL.                  |
| `u`, `url`       | *maybe*  |         | No     | `u`, `url`           | Safe Links URL to decode                                                      |
| `f`, `inputfile` | *maybe*  |         | No     | *valid path to file* | Path to file containing Safe Links URLs to decode                             |

NOTE: If an input `url` is not specified (e.g., via flag, positional argument
or standard input) a prompt is provided to enter a Safe Links URL.

##### Positional Argument

A URL pattern is accepted as a single positional argument in place of the `u`
or `url` flag. It is recommended that you quote the URL pattern to help
prevent some of the characters from being interpreted as shell commands (e.g.,
`&` as an attempt to background a command).

##### Standard input (e.g., "piping")

One or more URL patterns can be provided by piping them to the `usl` tool.

An attempt is made to decode all input URLs (no early exit). Successful
decoding results are emitted to `stdout` with decoding failures emitted to
`stderr`. This allows for splitting success results and error output across
different files (e.g., for later review).

##### Without arguments or flags

The `usl` tool can also be called without any input (e.g., flags, positional
argument, standard input). In this scenario it will prompt you to insert/paste
the URL pattern (quoted or otherwise).

#### `dsl`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This tool is in early development and behavior is subject to change.

##### Flags

> [!NOTE]
> üõ†Ô∏è This is a planned feature but is not yet available.

##### Positional Argument

> [!NOTE]
> üõ†Ô∏è This is a planned feature but is not yet available.

##### Standard input (e.g., "piping")

Text with interspersed URLs (separated by whitespace) can be provided for
decoding by piping it to the `dsl` tool. Output is sent to `stdout`.

Each matched Safe Links URL is replaced with a decoded version leaving
surrounding text as-is.

##### Without arguments or flags

The `dsl` tool can also be called without any input. In this scenario it will
prompt you to insert/paste content for decoding.

If no input is provided for a the listed amount of time the `dsl` tool will
timeout and exit.

## Examples

### `usl` tool

Though probably not required for all terminals, we quote the Safe Links URL to
prevent unintended interpretation of characters in the URL.

#### Using url positional argument

```console
$ usl 'SafeLinksURLHere'
https://go.dev/dl/
```

#### Using url flag

```console
$ usl --url 'SafeLinksURLHere'
https://go.dev/dl/
```

#### Using input prompt

In this example we just press enter so that we will be prompted for the input
URL pattern.

```console
$ usl
Enter URL: SafeLinksURLHere
https://go.dev/dl/
```

#### Using standard input (e.g., "piping")

```console
$ cat file.with.links | usl
https://go.dev/dl/
http://example.com
http://example.net
```

```console
$ echo 'SafeLinksURLHere' | usl
https://go.dev/dl/
```

#### Using filename flag

```console
$ usl --filename file.with.links
https://go.dev/dl/
http://example.com
http://example.net
```

#### Verbose output

```console
$ usl --verbose --url 'SafeLinksURLHere'

Expanded values from the given link:

  data      : PLACEHOLDER
  host      : nam99.safelinks.protection.outlook.com
  reserved  : 0
  sdata     : PLACEHOLDER
  url       : https://go.dev/dl/
```

### `dsl` tool

#### Using url positional argument

> [!NOTE]
> üõ†Ô∏è This is a planned feature but is not yet available.

#### Using url flag

> [!NOTE]
> üõ†Ô∏è This is a planned feature but is not yet available.

#### Using input prompt

In this example we just press enter so that we will be prompted for the input
URL pattern.

```console
$ dsl
Enter single or multi-line input. Press Ctrl-C to stop (or wait 15s for timeout).

  - Feedback from this app is sent to stderr.
  - Decoding results are sent to stdout.
  - Tip: Redirect stdout to a file for multiple input lines.


```

Not shown is the copy/pasted content with Safe Links encoded URLs interspersed
(e.g., right-click pasted into console).

#### Using standard input (e.g., "piping")

```console
$ cat file.with.mixed.text.content | dsl
tacos are great https://go.dev/dl/ but so are cookies http://example.com
```

```console
$ echo 'SafeLinksURLHere' | dsl
https://go.dev/dl/
```

```console
$ dsl < file.with.mixed.text.content > decoded-output.txt
tacos are great https://go.dev/dl/ but so are cookies http://example.com
```

#### Using filename flag

> [!NOTE]
> üõ†Ô∏è This is a planned feature but is not yet available.
