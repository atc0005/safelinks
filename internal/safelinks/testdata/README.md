## About this content

Unless noted otherwise, decoded content should retain the same line endings as
the original encoded content. Files in this directory are used by project
tests to assert that intended behavior.

Most (if not all) files have very specific formatting. Any modifications to
files should be made with care.

The `.gitattributes` file at the root of this project instructs git to leave
the line endings in these test files as-is to help prevent unintentional
changes.

When modifying these files using Visual Studio Code, choose the `File: Save
without Formatting` option to retain existing formatting. Other editors likely
have a similar mode to avoid changing existing file formatting.
