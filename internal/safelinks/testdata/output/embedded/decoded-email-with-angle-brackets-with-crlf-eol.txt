Subject: Blog migration status update

Hello team,

The redirect for <http://blog.example.com/> is now live. Visitors to that URL
will be redirected to (the now static archive) at
<http://www.example.com/blog/archive>.

As we discussed previously, the new blog is a static site maintained using
Hugo and CI/CD workflows. While all merge requests to the "public" branch will
continue to be vetted by marketing, all technical leads are encouraged to
publish early drafts to the dev site for review.

For those new to the team, the documentation at the following URLs covers the
process in depth:

<https://docs.example.com/guides/blog/best-practices>
<https://docs.example.com/guides/blog/publishing-drafts>
<https://docs.example.com/guides/blog/promoting-to-public>

P.S.

If you haven't yet, please give the latest release of our linkchecker web app
a try and let us know what you think! Per request, we offer it in http and
https variations.
